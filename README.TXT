PROJECT TITLE: Programming Final Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this is to model athletes and their activies using java,
practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, and the use of enums and collections.
VERSION or DATE: 2025/04/28 0.1.0
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: First, we analyzed the project requirements and created a UML 
digram to design the stucture of our program.
Then, we translated the digram into Java by creating the main classes, enums, feilds, and methods.
Now, we are completing the full project by implemting the logic, tesing it
using a driver class, and preparing documentation like the README and Javadoc.
