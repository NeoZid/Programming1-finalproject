PROJECT TITLE: Programming Final Project
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: The purpose of this is to model athletes and their activies using java,
practicing Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance, and the use of enums and collections.
VERSION or DATE: 2025/04/28 0.1.0
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: First, we analyzed the project requirements and created a UML 
digram to design the stucture of our program.
Then, we translated the digram into Java by creating the main classes, enums, feilds, and methods.
Now, we are completing the full project by implementing the logic, testing it
using a driver class, and preparing documentation like the README and Javadoc.

USER INSTRUCTIONS: 

As you open the app, you have a few options to choose from. Input the number associated with
what you want to do. The first thing you should do is to sign up where you input your name, age, weight and gender.
Keep in mind, you are able to create multiple profiles! After that, you need to create an activity that fits your needs. 
If you need an equipment, you are directed into the Powered Activity which include Biking, Rollerskates and Skiing. 
If our presets dont fancy you, you can also create your own equipment! Otherwise, you are directed into the Regular 
activities such as Walking, Running, Pushups, and Planks. These activities showcase how much you have travelled, for how long
and how much calories you burned. In the end, you are able to list the history of activities done to keep track of your progress 
and view how much distance travelled while using the app. That pretty much covers our entire app. Thank you for using StrongAF!
